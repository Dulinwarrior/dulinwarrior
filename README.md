### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Dulin De Alwis. I am 12 years old. I go to Lyceum International School Nugegoda. My hobbies are building LEGO and riding my bicycle. I used to love coding since I was 9 years old. I first started when I saw a post on Facebook about a coding class. After I attended it, I found my inner creativity. By now I have developed many small apps, and websites using HTML. I am learning Javascript and Python and I like HTML a lot and am very familiar with it other than the other programming languages I know. I urge for the comouter science period at school as it is so fun. At school, we mainly focus on the basics of Python and using Inkscape to make pictures and various designs, I also like History Geography. Recently I got one of those RC hobby cars that go extremely fast, and I think that it will be one of my hobbies from now on. At home, I use YouTube to gather more knowledge about programming. In the holidays I practise my coding skills at home. At the beginning of my coding journey, I used to think that using apps such as Microsoft Word was coding, but after I gathered some more knowledge, I truly understood the true purpose of coding. There are also many advantages of learning to program, in the future many records state that coding will be the number one job in the world. Unfortunately, there have been some people who tried to destroy my love of coding but I overcame that all and stayed strong. In the future, I am planning to collaborate with some of my friends and start an app-developing company that will be a global sensation that will positively affect many people's lives. My ambition is to be a software engineer. Thank you for reading this! Bye!.
